Tradebook
=========
Tradebook is a barter app intended for use by UCSD students. Students must login using their @ucsd.edu email address, and from there can post what they NEED, and what they are willing to GIVE in return. Students benefit from being able to query people in their immediate surroundings for help, and the helpers are insentivized to do so through getting rewards.
Examples would be "I need notes for CSE 101, I'll give you a sandwich." or "I need a ride to Ralphs, I'll buy you beer.".

To keep things honest, both helpers and helpees are reviewed after the transaction, from 1 to 5 stars, and those with lower or poor reviews will be filtered out.
